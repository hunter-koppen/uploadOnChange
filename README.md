## UploadOnChange
Add an on change Action (Micro/Nanoflow) to the standard Mendix file and image upload widgets

## Usage
Simply add the widget above or below the file/image upload widget from Mendix and configure the action you want to trigger. It will try to find the closest file/image uploader and add the action to it.
